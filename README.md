### Project Description
SoulCart began when a particularly friendly specter insisted on helping us fold laundry. Since then, we‚Äôve dedicated ourselves to matching exceptional spirits with equally exceptional people. Every soul is curated with care, documented with whimsy, and delivered with a gentle whoosh.

This is a playful, satirical e-commerce prototype built for fun and for learning modern full-stack patterns: responsive UI, cart flows, payment(QR), product listings, wishlist, and order lifecycle. All data and souls are fictional.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Tired of buying boring, physical things like clothes, phones, and groceries? Fed up with shopping for stuff that actually exists in the real world? In today‚Äôs fast-paced, materialistic society, there‚Äôs a severe shortage of places to purchase the one thing that truly matters ‚Äî souls. Billions of people go about their lives never owning even a single extra spirit. Shocking. Unacceptable. Spiritually empty.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Enter Soul Cart ‚Äî the world‚Äôs first (and only) online marketplace dedicated to buying, reserving, and collecting one-of-a-kind souls. We‚Äôve combined state-of-the-art ecommerce tech with ancient afterlife procurement techniques to deliver spirits straight to your digital cart. Want to prebook a 17th-century poet‚Äôs soul? Done. Pay via QR code. Add souls to your wishlist like you‚Äôre building a supernatural Pok√©mon collection? You bet.
